# Project Title

Musical Cup Piano

## Items Needed

My build has:

-Arduino x2
-Photoresistors x8
-Breadboards x4
-560 ohm resistors x8
-Piezo speakers x8
(additional resistors may be needed depending on the piezo speaker)

### Installing

To install this on to your Arduinos, just take the code and throw it into the Arduino program. Make sure you add 'pitches.h' into another tab in each of the Arduino code areas

## Running the tests

With how this is set up, the serial print will print you the values for each photoresistor. Adjust the thresholding aka the '(photo_value(2/3/4) > **80**)' part of the code to respond only when you hover your hand slightly over each cup.
